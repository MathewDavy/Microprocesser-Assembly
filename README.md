# Microprocesser-Assembly
Completed: 3 June, 2019

This was my final assignment for COMPX203. 
It is written in assembly code for the Waikato RISC Architecture Microprocessor.

It is a multi tasking kernel that uses exceptions and interrupts to perform three different tasks.

It runs on the Waikato University Basys boards or the Basys board simulator
